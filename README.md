## Description
Hello, my name is Benjamin Jawer. I am a senior majoring in Applied Mathematics at Wheaton College in Wheaton, IL. I find data fascinating because of the insights that can be gained from it, and I hope to share some of those fascinating insights with others. 
Down below, you will be able to view my resume and one of the projects that I completed during my Applied Data Science class this semester.

## Projects

The following project looks at some tortoise migration patterns. This migration had already been studied by a group of researchers, and you can read their paper [here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ecy.2658). To look specifically at the data, just click [here](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.834).
I looked specifically at the tortoises named Christian and Alison, but there are several other tortoises to look at.

[Here](https://BenjaminJawer.github.io/BenjaminJawer_Portfolio/Project_2.html) is an html version of the project.

If you would like to download and run the Jupyter notebook of my second project, [here](https://github.com/BenjaminJawer/AppliedDataScience/blob/main/Homework/Project_2.ipynb) is the link to it in GitHub!
